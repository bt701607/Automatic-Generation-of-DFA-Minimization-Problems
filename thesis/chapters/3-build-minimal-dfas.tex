\chapter{Generating minimal DFAs} \label{ch:3}

We seek algorithms for generation of minimal DFAs that fulfill the conditions defined in the requirements analysis section~\ref{ch:2:requirements-analysis}. We formally subsume these conditions via the GenerateNewMinimalDFA-problem:
\begin{definition}[GenerateNewMinimalDFA] $ $ \\
	$ $ \vspace{-0.4cm} \\
	\noindent $\underline{\emph{Given:}}$
	\vspace{-0.5cm}
	\begin{align*}
	\nSO \in \mathbb{N}\ \ \ & \emph{number of states} \\
	\kAL \in \mathbb{N}\ \ \ & \emph{alphabet size} \\
	\nF \in \mathbb{N}\ \ \ & \emph{number of final states} \\
	m_{min}, m_{max} \in \mathbb{N}\ \ \ & \emph{lower and upper bound for $\mmD$-value} \\
	p \in \{0,1\}\ \ \ & \emph{planarity-bit}
	\end{align*}
	\noindent $\underline{\emph{Task:}}$ \emph{Compute, if it exists, a solution DFA $A_{sol}$ with}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item $|Q_{sol}|=\nSO$, $|\Sigma_{sol}|=\kAL$, $|F_{sol}|=\nF$
		\item $m_{min} \le \mmD(A_{sol}) \le m_{max}$
		\item $A_{sol}$ \emph{being planar iff} $p = 1$
		\item $A_{sol}$ \emph{being new}
	\end{itemize}
\end{definition}
\noindent We consider different approaches to solve this problem, of which those using trial-and-error will be discussed most broadly.

\begin{remark}\label{ch:3:rem:qas-set}
	Note that for all generated DFAs we are going to set $Q_{sol} = [[\nSO]] = \{0,\ldots,\nSO-1\}$, $\Sigma_{sol} = [[\kAL]] = \{0,\ldots,\kAL-1\}$ and $s_{sol} = 0$, so every DFA of same state number and alphabet size will have the same states and symbols.
\end{remark}
\noindent As a consequence the presented algorithms will not be able to compute all of $\Amin$.

\section{Using a rejection algorithm}

We describe a procedure that is essentially a \emph{rejection algorithm} adjusted to find solution DFAs. The approach works as follows:

Firstly a \emph{test} DFA $A_{test}$ is generated by use of either randomness or enumeration. Alphabet size and number of (final) states will already be correct. On this DFA then tests will be executed, to check if it is minimal, planar (if wished) and new. If this is the case, $A_{test}$ will be returned, if not, new test DFAs are generated until all tests pass.

A note on the search space. If we would not restrict ourselves to $Q_{sol} = [[\nSO]]$ and $\Sigma_{sol} = [[\kAL]]$, then for a given number of states and symbols, the number of possible state sets and alphabets would be infinite. This way however we do not have to iterate through infinitely many same-sized versions of $Q_{sol}$ respectively $\Sigma_{sol}$. Since there is a finite number of possible transitions functions and final state sets given $\nSO, \kAL$, we can now even guarantee that our algorithm terminates.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\Function{BuildNewMinimalDFA-1\ }{$\nSO, \kAL, \nF, m_{min}, m_{max} \in \mathbb{N}, p \in \{0,1\}$}
		\While {True}
		
			\vspace{0.2cm}
		
			\State generate DFA $A_{test}$ with $|Q|, |\Sigma|, |F|$ matching $\nSO, \kAL, \nF$
			
			\vspace{0.2cm}
			
			\If {$A_{test}$ not minimal \textbf{or not} $m_{min} \leq \mmD(A_{test}) \leq m_{max}$}
				\State \textbf{continue}
			\EndIf
			
			\If {$p = 1$ \textbf{and} $A_{test}$ is not planar}
				\State \textbf{continue}
			\EndIf
			
			\If {$A_{test}$ is not new}
				\State \textbf{continue}
			\EndIf
			
			\vspace{0.2cm}
			
			\State\Return $A_{test}$
		\EndWhile
	\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\vspace{0.2cm}
We will complete this algorithm by resolving how the tests in lines $4, 6$ and $8$ work and by showing two methods for generation of automatons with given restrictions of $|Q|, |\Sigma|$ and $|F|$.

\subsection{Ensuring Correctness of D-value and Minimality}

In order to test, whether $A_{test}$ is minimal, we could simply use the minimization algorithm and compare the resulting DFA and $A_{test}$ using an isomorphy test. However it is sufficient to ensure, that no equivalent or unreachable states exist.

To get $\mmD(A_{test})$, we have to run \CompDist\ entirely anyway. Hence we can combine the test for equivalent states with computing the DFAs $\mmD$-value:
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\Function{HasEquivalentStates}{$A$}
		\State $depth \gets 0$
		\State $M \gets \{ (p,q), (q,p)\ |\ p \in F, q \notin F \}$
		\Do
			\State $depth \gets depth + 1$
			\State $M' \gets \{ (p,q)\ |\ (p,q) \notin M \land \exists \sigma \in \Sigma \colon (\delta(p,\sigma), \delta(q,\sigma)) \in M \}$
			\State $M \gets M \cup M'$
		\doWhile {$M' \neq \emptyset$}
		\State $hasDupl \gets | \{ (p,q)\ |\ p \neq q \land (p,q) \notin M \} | > 0$
		\State \Return $hasDupl, depth$
	\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\vspace{0.2cm}
Since \CompDist\ basically computes all distinguishable state pairs $\not\sim_A$, we test in line $9$, whether there is a pair of distinguishable states not in $\not\sim_A$.

Regarding the unreachable states, we can just use \CompUnr\ and test whether the computed set is empty:
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\Function{HasUnreachableStates}{$A$}
	\State \Return $|\CompUnr(A)| > 0$
	\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}

\subsection{Ensuring planarity}

There exist several algorithms for planarity testing of graphs. In this work, the library \emph{pygraph}\footnote{\url{https://github.com/jciskey/pygraph}} has been used, which implements the Hopcroft-Tarjan planarity algorithm. More information on this can be found for example in this~\cite{Koc93} introduction from William Kocay. The original paper describing the algorithm is by Hopcroft and Tarjan~\cite{HT74}.

\subsection{Ensuring uniqueness}

In our requirements we stated, that we wanted the generated solution DFA to be new, meaning not isomorph to any previously generated solution DFA. This implies the need of a database, that allows saving and loading DFAs. We name this database \emph{DB1}. Assuming the database is relational, the following scheme is proposed:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}
	$|Q_A|$ & |$\Sigma_A$| & $|F_A|$ & $\mmD(A)$ & $isPlanar(A)$ & $encode(A)$
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
With this scheme we can fetch once all DFAs matching the search parameters. Thus we need not fetch all previously found DFAs every time, but only those that are relevant. Afterwards we must only check whether any isomorphy test on the current test DFA and one of the fetched DFAs is positive. If any test DFA passes all tests and is going to be returned, then we have to save that DFA in the database.

A more concrete specification of this proceeding is shown below, embedded in the main algorithm:
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\Function{BuildNewMinimalDFA-2\ }{$\nSO, \kAL, \nF, m_{min}, m_{max}, p$}
	
		\vspace{0.2cm}
	
		\State $l \gets$ all DFAs in DB1 matching $\nSO, \kAL, \nF, m_{min}, m_{max}, p$
		
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		
		\While {True}
		
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		
			\State $\ldots$
			\If {$A_{test}$ is isomorph to any DFA in $l$}
				\State \textbf{continue}
			\EndIf
			
			\vspace{0.2cm}
			
			\State save $A_{test}$ and its respective properties in DB1
			\State\Return $A_{test}$
		\EndWhile
	\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\vspace{0.2cm}
To test whether $A_{test}$ is isomorph to any found DFA, we use the isomorphism test described in section~\ref{ch:2:sec:isom}.

\subsection{Option 1: Generating Test DFAs via Randomness}

We now approach the task of generating a random DFA whereas alphabet and number of (final) states are set. For our generated DFA we choose $Q_{sol}$, $\Sigma_{sol}$ and the start state as explained in remark~\ref{ch:3:rem:qas-set}.

The remaining elements that need to be defined are $\delta$ and $F$. The set of final states is supposed to have a size of $\nF$ and be a subset of $Q$. Therefore we can simply choose randomly $\nF$ distinct states from $Q$.

The transition function has to make the DFA complete, so we have to choose an ``end'' state $q'$ for every state-symbol-pair $q,\sigma$ in $Q \times \Sigma$. There is no restriction concerning $q'$, so we can randomly choose $\delta(q, \sigma) = q'$ from $Q$.

With defining how to compute $\delta$ we have covered all elements of a DFA.

\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\Function{BuildNewMinimalDFA-3a\ }{$\nSO, \kAL, \nF, m_{min}, m_{max}, p$}
	
		\vspace{0.2cm}
	
		\State $l \gets$ all DFAs in DB1 matching $\nSO, \kAL, \nF, m_{min}, m_{max}, p$
		\State $Q \gets[[\nSO]]$
		\State $\Sigma \gets [[\kAL]]$
		
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		
		\While {True}
		
		\vspace{0.2cm}
		
			\State $\delta \gets \emptyset$
			\For {$q$ \textbf{in} $Q$}
				\For {$\sigma$ \textbf{in} $\Sigma$}
					\State $\delta(q,\sigma) = $ random chosen state from $Q$
				\EndFor
			\EndFor
			\State $s \gets 0$
			\State $F \gets$ random sample of $\nF$ states from $Q$
			\State $A_{test} \gets (Q, \Sigma, \delta, s, F)$
			
			\vspace{0.2cm}
			
			\If {$A_{test}$ not minimal \textbf{or not} $m_{min} \leq \mmD(A_{test}) \leq m_{max}$}
			\State \textbf{continue}
			\EndIf
			
			\If {$p = 1$ \textbf{and} $A_{test}$ is not planar}
			\State \textbf{continue}
			\EndIf
			
			\If {$A_{test}$ is isomorph to any DFA in $l$}
			\State \textbf{continue}
			\EndIf
			
			\vspace{0.2cm}
			
			\State save $A_{test}$ and its respective properties in DB1
			\State\Return $A_{test}$
		\EndWhile
	\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\vspace{0.2cm}

\subsection{Option 2: Generating Test DFAs via Enumeration}

% enumerating instead of random

The second method of test DFA generation is based on the idea, that instead of randomly generating $F$ and $\delta$, we could just enumerate through all possible final state sets and transition functions.

% finite enumerations, how many

Both enumerations are finite, given $\nSO$ and $\kAL$. Having a requirement of $\nF$ final states, then $\binom{\nSO}{\nF}$ is the number of possible $F$-configurations. On the other hand there are $\nSO^{\nSO\kAL}$ possible $\delta$-configurations: We have to choose one of $\nSO$ possible end states for every combination in $Q\times\Sigma$ - so $\nSO\kAL$ times.

% Two fields

Again we will call our states and symbols $[[\nSO]]$ resp.\ $[[\kAL]]$. We will represent the state of an enumeration with two fields $F_F$ and $F_\delta$. The first field shall have $\nSO$ Bits, whereas Bit $F_F[i] \in \{0,1\}$ represents the information, whether $i$ is a final state or not. The second field shall have $\nSO\kAL$ entries containing state names, such that entry $F_\delta[i * \kAL + j] = q, q\in [[\nSO]]$ says, that $\delta(i, j) = q$.

% -- EX example of the two fields and their meaning

\begin{example}
	{\raggedright\itshape Given $\nSO = 4$, $\kAL = 2$, $\nF = 3$. Note that for the sake of readability we will use $a,b,\ldots$ instead of $0,1,2,\ldots$ as alphabet symbols. An example $F_F$-array could be $1101$. Since $F_F[i]$ is $1$ for $i = 0,1,3$ the final states are:
	\begin{tabbing}
		\qquad$F = \{\ 0, 1, 3\ \}$
	\end{tabbing}
	{\raggedright A possible $F_\delta$-array could be $12013201$. The following table depicts, how $F_\delta$ assigns one state to every combination of states and symbols $(q,\sigma) \in Q\times\Sigma$ and thus defines $\delta$:\par}

% how to compute next DFA

\noindent Given an enumeration state $F_F, F_\delta$ and $\nSO, \kAL, \nF$ we will then compute the next DFA based on this state as follows. We will treat both fields as numbers, $F_F$ as $2$-ary and $F_\delta$ as $\nSO$-ary. To get to the next DFA, we will first increment $F_\delta$ by $1$. If $F_\delta = \nSO-1 \ldots \nSO-1$, then we increment $F_F$ until it contains $\nF$ ones (again) and set $F_\delta$ to $0 \ldots 0$. This behavior is summarized in the following algorithm:
\vspace{0.2cm}
\begin{algorithmic}[1]
	\Function{IncrementEnumProgress\ }{$F_F, F_\delta, \nSO, \kAL, \nF$}
	\State add $1$ to $(F_\delta)_\nSO$
	\If {$F_\delta = 0 \ldots 0$}
		\While {$\#_1(F_F) \neq \nF$} \Comment{if the number of 1s in $F_F$ is not $\nF$}
			\State add $1$ to $(F_F)_2$
			\If {$F_F = 0\ldots 0$}
				\State \Return $\bot$
			\EndIf
		\State $F_\delta = 0 \ldots 0$
		\EndWhile
	\EndIf
	\State \Return $F_F, F_\delta$
	\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\vspace{0.2cm}
In this algorithm we assume, that adding $1$ to a $n$-ary number $n-1\ n-1\ \ldots n-1$ yields $00\ldots0$.

% EX -- example of an enumProgress increment
	
\begin{example}
	We showcase a sample enumeration at points, that demonstrate the semantics of different increments. We will use $\nSO=4$, $\kAL=2$ and $\nF=2$. Note that we will use $a,b,\ldots$ instead of $0,1,\ldots$ as symbols again. Valid enumeration progresses are depicted green.\par
	\vspace{0.4cm}\noindent
	\begin{minipage}{0.56\textwidth}
		We will start with the initial enumeration progress (1). In this case, a simple addition of $1$ to $F_\delta$ does not cause an overflow of $F_\delta$ (2), meaning the enumeration increment is already finished.\newline
		
		(3). In this state however $F_\delta$ becomes $0\ldots0$ (4) after adding $1$. Thus we add $1$ to $F_F$, until it contains the required number of ones again (so we always have $f$ final states). The next $4$-ary number with $2$ ones after $0011$ is $0101$ (5).\newline
		
		(6). Here $F_\delta$ is at its maximum and there is no higher $4$-ary number with $2$ ones. So if the algorithm is now applied and tries to get the next valid $F_F$-value, it will eventually reach (7), which indicates the enumeration has found its end.

	\EndFor
	\State \Return $(Q, \Sigma, \delta, s, F)$
	\EndFunction
\end{algorithmic}
\vspace{0.2cm}
The initial field values are each time $0\ldots 0$. Note how construction and use of these fields results in DFAs with correct alphabet size and number of (final) states. An enumeration can finish either because a matching DFA has been found or all DFAs have been enumerated. The latter is the case, if $F_F = 1\ldots 1$ and $F_\delta = \nSO-1 \ldots \nSO-1$.

% saving enumProgress for later progression

Once the enumeration within a call of \textsc{BuildNewMinimalDFA} has been finished, it is reasonable to \emph{save} the enumeration progress (meaning the current content of $F_F, F_\delta$), such that during the next call enumeration can be resumed from that point on. The alternative would mean, that the enumeration is run in its entirety until that point again, whereas all so far found DFAs would be found to be not new. Thus we introduce a second database $DB2$ with the following table:
\begin{center}
	\begin{tabular}{c c c c c c}
		$|Q_A|$ & |$\Sigma_A$| & $F_F$ & $F_\delta$
	\end{tabular}
\end{center}
We reduce the enumeration room for each calculation.

\section{On alternative approaches}

Build $m$ from $m$-\CompDist\ iteratively. (Why would this basically result in running \CompDist\ all the time?)

\section{Related work on DFA generation}

Nicaud provides an overview of results on random generation and combinatorial properties of DFAs in ~\cite{Nic14}. We will outline relevant related work.

Nicaud's summary indicates, that research has focused on randomized generation of accessible, but not minimal DFAs so far. In the following we will sketch some approaches that have come up.

\paragraph*{Using the recursive method.}

Champarnaud and Paranthoën~\cite{CP05} continue ideas started by Nicaud in his thesis~\cite{Nic00}. Let $\mathfrak{F_{n,m}}$ be the set of extended $m$-ary trees of order $n$. These trees are characterized by a partitioning $V = N \uplus L$ with $|N| = n$ and the properties $v \in N \Rightarrow d^+(v) = m$ and $v \in L \Rightarrow d^+(v) = 0$. We define the following set of tuples using $s=n(m-1)$:
\[
    \mathfrak{R_{m,n}} = \{\ (k_1,\ldots,k_s) \in \mathbb{N}^s\ |\ \forall i\in [2,s]\colon k_i \geq \left\lceil\frac{i}{m-1}\right\rceil\ and\ k_i \geq k_{i-1}\ \}
\]
In~\cite[p. 6]{CP05} it is shown that there exists a bijection $\varphi$ between $\mathfrak{F_{n,m}}$ and $\mathfrak{R_{m,n}}$ which maps to $k_i$, $i\in[1,s]$ of a tuple the number of leaves visited before the $i$th leaf in a tree. The connection to accessible DFAs is established by proving that  ``transition structures\footnotemark''\ with $|Q|=n$, $|\Sigma|=m$ reduced to the set of the smallest paths from the $s$ to each other state are in bijection with extended $m$-ary trees of order $n$ (see~\cite[p. 8]{CP05}).

As a consequence they are able to construct a random generation of accessible complete DFAs using the ``recursive method'' from~\cite{NW78} which generates $n$-tuples~\cite[p. 10]{CP05}. Nicaud states in his survey that the algorithm's runtime is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$ but notes, that generation of DFAs with more than ``a few thousand states'' is practically hard to do~\cite[pp. 10-11]{Nic14}.
\footnotetext{Those are essentially DFAs without final state sets.}

Almeida et al.~\cite{AAA09, AMR09, RMA05} present and implement methods using a string-encoding of DFAs for exact enumeration and random generation of DFAs. Nicaud~\cite[p. 11]{Nic14} states in a remark, that this approach uses the same recursive method and differs only in the DFA encoding.

\paragraph*{Using Boltzmann sampler.}

Bassino, David and Nicaud present and implement a more efficient random generator of accessible complete DFAs in~\cite{BDN07, BN07}. Their idea is based on so called Boltzmann samplers. This framework of samplers is characterized in particular by the fact that the size of its generated objects are not fixed but in an interval around a given input size - this stands in opposition to most random generators in literature~\cite[p. 2]{DFL04}.

In~\cite{BN07} the authors use a Boltzmann sampler to generate set partitions that are shown to be in bijection with so called box diagrams~\cite[p. 8]{BN07} which are in turn in bijection to accessible complete DFAs~\cite[p. 4]{BN07}. They thus acquire an average runtime complexity of $\mathcal{O}(n^{3/2})$ for a single random generation.

\paragraph*{Using a rejection algorithm.}

Carayol and Nicaud~\cite{CN12} give a simple algorithm with the same runtime complexity. They use a result stating that the size of accessible DFAs is concentrated around some computable value. In the end random possibly inaccessible DFAs of a specific size are generated, of which afterwards all unreachable states are deleted. This is thus essentially a rejection algorithm with clever generation of test DFAs. They furthermore show that allowing approximate sampling with the number of states being in $[n-\varepsilon\sqrt{n}, n+\varepsilon\sqrt{n}]$ results in linear expected runtime.

\paragraph*{Others and comparison to algorithm presented in this work.}

In his survey Nicaud mentions a paper by Bassino and Sportiello~\cite{BS13} that yields random generation of accessible DFAs in expected linear time. This work will not be discussed further here.

In this work we use a rejection algorithm that generates test DFAs either by randomization or by enumeration. Both methods implement a naive approach. The generated test DFAs are not necessary minimal and in particular not necessary accessible as in~\cite{CN12}. The enumeration method uses encodings of DFAs similar to those used by Almeida et.\ al.~\cite{RMA05}.


\section{Empirical and combinatorial results}

Concerning combinatorial properties of DFAs, several authors (e.g.~\cite{BN07, DKS02, HJ14}) consider a work from Vyssotsky~\cite{Vys59} in the Bell laboratories to be the first on this subject. A contribution by Korshunov~\cite{Kor78} is often cited in this regard, for he firstly ``determines an asymptotic estimate of the number of accessible complete and deterministic $n$-state automata over a finite alphabet''~\cite{BDS11}.

Implementations (e.g.~\cite{AAA09, BDN07}) of various random and enumeration generation methods have given rise to several empirical observations concerning the number of minimal DFAs, their fraction among all DFAs and so forth.

Domaratzki, Kisman, and Shallit~\cite{DKS02} give some asymptotic estimates and explicit computations for the number of each several types of languages and automata that are distinct. The here relevant results have been subsumed and extended in~\cite[p. 8]{AMR09} by means of exact enumeration and are confirmed in~\cite{BDN07}.

\noindent In table~\ref{fig:dfa_minimal_ratios} we use these results to determine the ratios of minimal complete DFAs among all complete DFAs for given $|Q|$ and $|\Sigma|$. The number of all DFAs is computed as follows:
\[
|\mathcal{A}_{n,k}| = \underbrace{n^{n*k}}_{\#\text{possible }\delta\text{'s}} * \underbrace{2^n}_{\#\text{possible sets }F}
\]
Thus we gain an insight into how probable the generation of a distinct minimal test DFA is without applying further constraints. For our proposed default parameters $n\in[4-5]$ and $k\in[2-3]$ the probabilities of successful generation range from $1\%$ to $5\%$. Practical tests have shown that this leads to sufficient short run times for our implementation.

Further interesting results in this area include the determination of the fraction of minimal automata among accessible complete DFAs~\cite{BDS11} and asymptotic estimates for the number of states that a random minimized DFA has~\cite{BK13}.

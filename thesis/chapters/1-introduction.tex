\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:1}

% study computer science, (theoretical informatics), automata theory, value of this theory

Automata theory is recommended as part of a standard computer science curriculum~\cite[pp. 5-6]{GI16}. It provides the chance to gain a precise cognitive model yielding new perspectives on problems and givens. This may thus lead to increased problem solving skills and more accurate thinking.

% typical topic - minimization, (why typical)

A typical task in automata theory is the minimization of a given deterministic finite automaton (DFA). The classic textbook ``Introduction to automata theory, languages, and computation'' by Hopcroft et. al.~\cite{HMU01} presents a practicable minimization algorithm. In this work we will confine ourselves to look at DFA minimizations using that algorithm.

% sketch situation

In an introduction course to theoretical computer science minimization tasks are thus likely to occur in supplementary exercises or exams. As of the creation of such tasks, one may assume, that it is done mostly manually. Automation would yield here the following advantages:

\begin{itemize}
	\item freeing time for other things, e.g. research, helping students face-to-face, designing the whole exercise sheet
	
	\item generation of tasks which lie in a well-defined range
	
	\item increased predictability and consistency of the generated task properties, which can be adjusted accurately through various parameters
	
	\item saves human operators from the generating task which involves monotonous work
\end{itemize}

Engagement on this topic promises moreover increased clarification which kind of minimization tasks can be generated, and where difficulties of those tasks lie.

This work aims to provide theoretical foundations for a DFA minimization task generator. What requirements a user has towards such a program will be discussed in a short requirements analysis. Based on this work a DFA minimization generator will be devised. Alongside to this thesis an implementation of such a generator has been developed.
